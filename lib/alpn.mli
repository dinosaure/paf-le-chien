(** ALPN support.

    [Alpn] depend on [http/af] & [h2] and choose them because they share the
    same {!Paf.RUNTIME} interface. [Alpn] does not require [ocaml-tls] so it's
    possible to use OpenSSL. It requires, at least:

    - Something to extract ALPN result from the TLS {i flow}
    - Something to represent as the string the peer (useful for over-framework)
    - An injection function (available from [mimic])

    In other words, [Alpn] did the only choice to trust on [http/af] & [h2] to
    handle HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 and H2 protocols. *)

(** The type of information from a ['flow]:

    - [alpn] is a fonction which is able to extract the result of the
      negotiation between the client & the server about which protocol we need
      to start
    - [peer] returns a [string] representation of the given ['flow] to help to
      print out some logs about this client.
    - [injection] is the function which wraps the given ['flow] to a
      [Mimic.flow].

    For the last function, it can be done if you already registered the protocol
    with [mimic]. In that case, the second value given by [Mimic.register] helps
    you to {i inject} your flow as a [Mimic.flow]:

    {[
      let _, protocol = Mimic.register ~name:"my-protocol" (module My_protocol)

      let injection (flow : My_protocol.flow) : Mimic.flow =
        let module R = (val Mimic.repr protocol) in

(** [service info ~error_handler ~request_handler connect accept close] creates
    a new {!type:Paf.service} over the {i socket} ['t]. From the given
    implementation of [accept] and [close], we are able to instantiate the
    {i main loop}. Then, from the given [info], we extract informations such the
    application layer protocol and choose which protocol we will use. Currently,
    if [info.alpn] returns:

    - [Some "http/1.0" | Some "http/1.1" | None], we launch an [http/af] service
    - [Some "h2"], we launch an [h2] service

    The user is able to identify which protocol we launched by {!resp_handler}.
    The returned service can be run with {!Paf.serve}. Here is an example with
    [Lwt_unix.file_descr] and the TCP/IP transmission protocol (without ALPN
    negotiation):

    {[
      let _, protocol
        : Unix.sockaddr Mimic.value

(** [run ~sleep ?alpn ~error_handler ~response_handler edn req flow] tries
    communitate to [edn] via [flow] with a certain protocol according to the
    given [alpn] value and the given request. It returns the body of the request
    to allow the user to write on it (and communicate then with the server).

    [run] does only the ALPN dispatch. It does not instantiate the connection
    and it does not try to upgrade the protocol. It just choose the right HTTP
    protocol according to:

    - the given [alpn] value
    - the given [request] (if you want to communicate via HTTP/1.1 or H2)

    Here is an example with [mimic]:
